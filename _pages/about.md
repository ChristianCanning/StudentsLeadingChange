Welcome to the about page! We are a group of students at The Woodlands High School trying to make a positive impact on the world.
Our club creates content (primarily video) for social media to voice our opinions on a variety of issues. The club's main goal is
to provide a platform for students to promote the awareness of human and animal rights, the environment, ethics, and other world
or community issues. You may wonder why we choose to have such a large scope for our club. It is because if we were to narrow our 
focus, then this group wouldn't provide a place for its members to focus on the issues which they think are important. We also don't want
to limit our members' creativity or abilities.
